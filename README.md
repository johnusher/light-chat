# light-chat
* Light-chat is a Chat-GPT enabled system to control a strip of programmable LEDs using a text or voice prompt. For speech to text we use the OpenAI Whisper API. To program the LEDs we use an Arduino. The user prompt will generate new Arduino code to modify the existing light pattern or to generate a new pattern.

* We sometimes get invalid code from the ChatGPT response. We use the response from the Arduino compiler ```arduino-cli compile ``` to extract error messages and resend the invalid code and the error message to ChatGPT to get new and (hopefully) valid code.<br />

* This is a Golang and Arduino project using the Go openAI interface library [https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai) and the FastLED library [https://github.com/FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED).




# Usage

The main file is [light_chat_main.go](light_chat_main.go)

It determines if an Arduino is connected via USB, what COM port it is connected to, and what board type it is (atmega328 or Uno).

Command line execution:  <br /> 
```bash
go run .\light_chat_main.go
```
<br /> 

## Flags

* `-p` "make lights kinda blue"= text prompt input. If we do not use this p flag then we default to use voice input with the default microphone- we have 8 seconds to record.
* `-r` (bool) reset the reference (provided example) light pattern code to
  [xmasTwinkleDuino.c](xmasTwinkleDuino.c). This file contains information about
  the programable LED strip chipset (currently WS2812B), the number of LEDs on the
  strip, and which Arduino pin to use for the data output. If the flag is not
  used, the reference (provided example) light pattern code is
  [duinoCode.ino](duinoCode/duinoCode.ino). In summary: Use this `-r` flag when
  you want to reset the light pattern and make a new one (e.g. "make a new calm
  light pattern that is inspired by the poet John Donne"). Otherwise do not use
  the flag to modify whatever the existing pattern is (e.g. "make the light
  pattern less romantic").
* `-nb` (bool) = no board. Use this flag if no Arduino is connected but you
  still want to generate a response that is saved in directory
  [responseHistory](responseHistory).


# Examples

Previous examples are stored here in directory [ /responseHistory](responseHistory)

### 1. Barbie's dream house

 ```bash 
 go run .\light_chat_main.go -p "Make a light pattern showing Barbie's dream house." -nb -r
 ```

[![Watch the video]![Alt text](video/bdh.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/Lj5bpjEMJQU?feature=shared)

(The example in the video used an early version of the system with a different codeload than discussed below. The prompt was repeated just before the Arduino updated the lights.)

Response:<br /> 

[Barbie's dream house](<responseHistory/Please it Barbie's dream house-.txt>)


```Here is a modified code that displays a Barbie's Dream House themed light pattern by alternating between pink, cyan, and white lights, which imitates the traditional color scheme of Barbie. ++ It briefly flashes all LEDs red twice at the initial setup as requested ++ .```<br /> 
Note this last part ++ xxx ++ is an incorrect interpretation of rule #5:<br /> 
```	5. Only if you can not provide a valid response, please flash all LEDs red twice (do this just once) and then display the existing pattern.```

### 2. More Romantic.
 ```bash 
 go run .\light_chat_main.go -p "Now make the lights more romantic." -nb
 ```
This uses a text prompt input without the -r flag to modify the code generated by the previous response.<br /> 
This is the ChatGPT comment on the code:<br /> 

``` The above code will create a "romantic" atmosphere by decreasing the brightness to a soft glow (80 out of 255). It also slows down the frame rate to a calm 2 frames per second. Most importantly, it sets all the LEDs to red (CHSV(0, 255, 255) is a hue-saturation-value representation of the color red), which is traditionally associated with romance. ```

### 3. Age of Aquarius.
```I would like a monochrome black and white interpretation of the song Age of Aquarius.```

Response: [here](<responseHistory/I would like a monochrome black and white interpretation of the song Age of Aquarius.txt>)<br /> 
The C code did not compile first time- it used an undefined parameter HALF. But the response did not lack in ambition nor inventive interpretation :)

The function ```createNewPromptFromBadCode``` uses ChatGPT to modify such non-compilable "bad" code: the function takes the error message from the Arduino compiler and sends this to ChatGPT with the "bad" code, and asks it to correct the bad code so it compiles. If we again get "bad" code, we abort.

### 4.20.
 ```bash 
 go run .\light_chat_main.go -p "Make the colours suitable for a party at 420 wink-wink nudge-nudge say no more" -nb -r 
 ```
This uses a text prompt input, with no Arduino board connected, and using the default reference code in xmasTwinkleDuino.c.

 The ChatGPT response is stored in directory [responseHistory](responseHistory) as a text file with filename the same as the user prompt for the light pattern -  [example for above](<responseHistory/Make the colours suitable for an adult 4-20 party nudge-nudge wink-wink say.txt>).<br /> 

 We add "response rules" to ask ChatGPT to describe how it interpretted the prompt. For the above example, this is the comment it generated on the code:<br /> 
```Your ChristmasLights function was replaced by the PartyLights function. The colours were changed from a repeating pattern of red, green, white to green and purple. For a 4-20 themed party these colours are more suitable as green often represents marijuana and purple represents the feeling of relaxation and royalty.```


### 5. ... it's kinda complicated...
 ```bash go run .\light_chat_main.go -p "The requested display has 4 parts. Please try and do all 4 parts in sequence. Part 1: Display a single blue dot that moves down the lightstrip starting slow and speeding up as it moves. Part 2: When the blue dot reaches the end of the lightstrip turn it to a single yellow dot. Part 3: The yellow dot reflects and returns along the length of the lightstrip slowly flashing. Part 4: When the yellow dot reaches the end of the lightstrip flash all lights bright white 4 times." -r ```

[![Watch the video]![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qWUva9C1Yjc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qWUva9C1Yjc?feature=shared
)


This took 1min42 seconds to receive a response and the code compiled first time. <br /> 
It got it mostly right, except for the part 3. For some reason, in the  [response](<responseHistory/Display a single blue dot that moves down the lightstrip starting slow and .txt>) ChatGPT4 makes the yellow dot randomly blink:<br /> 
```Part3(): The yellow dot "returns" along the light strip, randomly blinking on its way back.```



# How it works
1. Obtain desired new or ammended light pattern using a text or microphone recording and convert speech to text using the OpenAI Whisper api.
2. Create a new prompt to replace or update the light pattern accordingly. <br /> 
We concat the following text:<br /> 
    "Here is an example of C code for an Arduino using the FastLED library to create light patterns for an LED strip.  This is the existing pattern:"<br /> 
    &lt; insert C code from example reference &gt; <br /> 
    " Please generate new C code to satisfy the following request and output the modified code in its entirety: "<br /> 
    &lt; user prompt &gt; <br /> 
    "These are the rules:"<br /> 
    &lt; 1. Always format the code in code blocks. etc...&gt;<br /> 
3. Send this new prompt to ChatGPT.
4. Receive ChatGPT response and parse for valid C code.
5. Compile new light pattern.
6. If the code does not compile, there is a function ```createNewPromptFromBadCode``` to use ChatGPT to amend such bad code : the function takes the error message from the Arduino compiler and sends this to ChatGPT with the "bad" code and we prompt ChatGPT to correct the bad code so it compiles. If we again get "bad" code, we abort.
7. We program the Arduino using the valid code from step 5/6.

# Problems, TODOs, comments


* It take typically 30-50 seconds to receive the response using ChatGPT4.
* Some colours look bad with RGB LEDS- e.g. brown and yellow, and white if no white LED.<br />
* It costs 1-4 cents for each prompt using ChatGPT4. The WhisperAPI is <0.1C per ~10 second prompt. I plan to have a "low res" version that uses ChatGPT3.5 Turbo and minimizes the response size (number of tokens) e.g. by removing comments.<br />
* The winmm.dll is pretty janky and about 1 in 10 times the microphone recording will not save: need to switch to using core-audio (for Linux compatability).
* Integrate other sensors onto the Arduino, e.g. microphone or accelerometer to sync. pattern with sound.
