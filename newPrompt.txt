Here is an example of C code for an Arduino using the FastLED library to create a christmas effect on an LED strip. This is the existing pattern: 
 ``` 
 #include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  // do not change
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  // do not change
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   // do not change
#define NUM_LEDS    30  // do not change

#define BRIGHTNESS  150    // set brightness of all LEDs. 150 is default
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5   // 20 is very fast, 10 is normal, 5 is slow. Above 30 is too fast.

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000); // sanity delay
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);  // set brightness of all LEDs
}

void loop() {
  ChristmasLights(); // run simulation frame
  
  FastLED.show(); // display this frame
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void ChristmasLights() {
  // Fill the LEDs with a repeating pattern of red, green, and white
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::Green;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::White;
  }

  // Optional: Add a twinkling effect
  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 50) { // adjust the probability to control twinkling
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black; // 'turn off' the LED randomly
//      leds[j].maximizeBrightness(brightness); // do not use maximizeBrightness!
    }
  }
}
 ``` 
 Please generate new C code to satisfy the following request and output the modified code in its entirety beginning with #include <FastLED.h> and include the line: #define COLOR_ORDER GRB. Please provide a response in C code. After the code please briefly explain the decision for your response. Here is the request: 
 Please make the lights display a single blue dot that travels down the light strip starting slow and speeding up as it travels. When the blue dot reaches the end turn it to a single yellow light that reflects and returns along the light strip slowly and flashing. When it reaches the end flash all lights bright white 4 times and then repeat this pattern but with the colours becoming more and more random.
	Remember: 1. Always format the code in code blocks. Begin and end the new C code with the code block symbol of 3 backticks.
	2. Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response. 
	3. The only allowed library is fastLED. Do not import or use any other library.
	4. If you are not sure what value to use, just use your best judge. Do not use None for anything.
	5. Only if you can not provide a valid response, please flash all LEDs red twice (do this just once) and then display the existing pattern.
