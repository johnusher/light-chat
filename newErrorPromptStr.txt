Here is some C code for an Arduino using the FastLED library to create light patterns for an LED strip: 
 ``` 
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN         6
#define COLOR_ORDER     GRB
#define CHIPSET         WS2812B
#define NUM_LEDS        30
#define BRIGHTNESS      150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 100 

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000); 
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  AquariusEffect();

  FastLED.show(HALF);
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void AquariusEffect() {
  static uint8_t brightness = 0;

  fill_solid(leds, NUM_LEDS, CRGB::White);
  fadeToBlackBy(leds, NUM_LEDS, brightness);
  brightness++;  

  if (brightness == 255) {
    brightness = 0;  
  } 
}

 ``` 
 The code does not compile. The compiler creates the following error message:
- 'HALF' was not declared in this scope
 Please use this error message to modify the provided code so the modified code compiles. Please provide a response in C code. After the code please briefly explain the decision for your response.  
 
Remember: 1. Always format the code in code blocks. Begin and end the new C code with the code block symbol of 3 backticks.
2. Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response. 
3. The only allowed library is fastLED. Do not import or use any other library.
4. If you are not sure what value to use, just use your best judge. Do not use None for anything.
