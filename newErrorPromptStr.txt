Here is some C code for an Arduino using the FastLED library to create light patterns for an LED strip: 
 ``` 
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B
#define NUM_LEDS    30

#define BRIGHTNESS  150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 120

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  TripZone();
  
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void TripZone() {
  static uint8_t hue = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    leds[i] = CHSV(hue++, 255, 255);
  }
}

 ``` 
 The code does not compile. The compiler creates the following  error messages: 
- redefinition of 'CRGB leds [30]'- redefinition of 'void setup()'- redefinition of 'void loop()'
 Please use this error message to modify the provided code so the modified code compiles. Please provide a response in C code. After the code please briefly explain the decision for your response.  
 
Remember: 1. Always format the code in code blocks. Begin and end the new C code with the code block symbol of 3 backticks.
2. Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response. 
3. The only allowed library is fastLED. Do not import or use any other library.
4. If you are not sure what value to use, just use your best judge. Do not use None for anything.
