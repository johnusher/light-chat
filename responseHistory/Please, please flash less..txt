Provide the modified C code to reduce the flashing rate of the LED lights. Use a lower value other than `50` to reduce the probability of an LED turning off, hence reducing the flashing.

```c
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6 
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB 
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   
#define NUM_LEDS    30  

#define BRIGHTNESS  150    
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5   

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
 
void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  BluebellForest();
  
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void BluebellForest() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Blue; 
  }

  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 20) { 
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black; 
    }
  }
}
```

In this modified C code, the flashing rate has been reduced by lowering the probability of an LED turning off inside the BluebellForest function. This was achieved by replacing the `50` in the if condition with `20`. Consequently, the twinkling effect is less frequent because the probability of an LED 'turning off' is lower.
