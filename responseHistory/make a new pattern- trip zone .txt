Based on the request, we can generate a "trip zone" LED pattern by altering the colors and sequence. I've chosen a sequence of Blue, White, and Purple (which might give a trippy effect).

Remember to test this code with your setup to adjust the timing, colors, and sequences as needed.

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B
#define NUM_LEDS    30

#define BRIGHTNESS  200
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 6 

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(3000); 
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);  
}

void loop() {
  TripZoneLights(); 
  FastLED.show(); 
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void TripZoneLights() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Blue; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::White;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::Purple;
  }

  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 20) { 
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black; 
    }
  }
}
```
In this pattern (Trip zone), we have kept the general pattern structure similar to the example code but changed the colors. We have replaced the colors with Blue, White, and Purple. We also slightly adjusted the brightness to 200 (a little brighter than the original) and the frames per second to 6 (a bit slower than the original) to create a somewhat different visual effect.

The random "blackouts" add an element of unpredictability to the pattern, creating a 'trip zone' effect. The chance for blackouts is decreased to 20 (from 50 originally), making them occur less frequently.
