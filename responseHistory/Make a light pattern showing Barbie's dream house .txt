**Explanation:**
- Replaced the Christmas colors (red, green, white) with colors that give a vibe of "Barbie's dream house" â€” DeepPink, MediumOrchid, and SkyBlue.
- Added a sparkling twinkling effect by randomly fading out the LEDs to create a dreamy look.
- Kept the structure and format similar to the provided Christmas pattern, ensuring consistency and simplicity in understanding the changes.
- The decision for the color scheme is based on the common representation and association of Barbie with vibrant pink and related dreamy colors.
