Here is a modified code that displays a Barbie's Dream House themed light pattern by alternating between pink, cyan, and white lights, which imitates the traditional color scheme of Barbie. It briefly flashes all LEDs red twice at the initial setup as requested. 

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  // do not change
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  // do not change
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   // do not change
#define NUM_LEDS    30  // do not change

#define BRIGHTNESS  150    // set brightness of all LEDs. 150 is default
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 10   // 20 is very fast, 10 is normal, 5 is slow. Above 30 is too fast.

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000); // sanity delay
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);  // set brightness of all LEDs
  
  // Initial setup: flash all LEDs red twice 
  FastLED.showColor(CRGB::Red);
  delay(500);
  FastLED.showColor(CRGB::Black);
  delay(500);
  FastLED.showColor(CRGB::Red);
  delay(500);
  FastLED.showColor(CRGB::Black);
  delay(500);
}

void loop() {
  BarbieLights(); // run simulation frame
  
  FastLED.show(); // display this frame
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void BarbieLights() {
  // Fill the LEDs with a repeating pattern of pink, cyan, and white
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Pink; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::Cyan;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::White;
  }

  // Optional: Add a twinkling effect
  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 50) { // adjust the probability to control twinkling
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black; // 'turn off' the LED randomly
//      leds[j].maximizeBrightness(brightness); // do not use maximizeBrightness!
    }
  }
}
``` 

In this code, the ChristmasLights() function was replaced with the BarbieLights() function that sets the LED colors to pink, cyan, and white in line with the traditional Barbie colors. Also, additional lines have been added to the setup() function to flash all LEDs red twice. All other requested conditions were met, and the original code structure was preserved where possible.
