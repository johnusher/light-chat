Here is the modified code designed to create a "jungle" lighting effect. The jungle theme is achieved by illuminating the LEDs with various shades of green, to represent the different shades of green in a jungle. Every once in a while, a random LED is lit up in a vibrant yellow or red to represent flowers, fruits, or animals to add a vibrant hue:

```c
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B
#define NUM_LEDS    30  
#define BRIGHTNESS  150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5  

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);  
}

void loop() {
  JungleLights(); 
  
  FastLED.show(); 
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void JungleLights() {
  // Fill the LEDs with different shades of green
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    leds[i] = CHSV(85, 255, random8(64, 255)); // shades of green
  }

  // Add occasional random vibrant hues
  if(random8() < 50) {
    leds[random16(NUM_LEDS)] = CHSV(random8(0, 64), 255, 255); // vibrant hues
  }
}
```

In the `JungleLights` function, the LEDs are first filled with different shades of green using the `CHSV` function with a hue of 85 (close to green) and saturation of 255 (full color), but a varying brightness between 64 and 255. This mimics the various levels of light filtering through a dense jungle canopy. 

Occasionally, a random LED is colored with a hue between 0 and 64 (an arbitrary range spanning red, orange, and yellow), symbolizing the bright colors of flowers, fruits, or animal life in the jungle. The occasional vibrant hue also breaks the uniformity of the green and gives the illusion of a living, dynamic environment.
