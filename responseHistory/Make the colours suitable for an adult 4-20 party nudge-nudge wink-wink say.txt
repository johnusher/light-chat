Here is a C code that will make the LED strip color suitable for an adult 4-20 party.

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B  
#define NUM_LEDS    30  

#define BRIGHTNESS  150  
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 10

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS]

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  PartyLights();
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void PartyLights() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Green;

    // Add a slow breathing effect by increasing and decreasing the brightness
    int breathe = sin8(millis() / 2 + i * 5);

    if (breathe < 128) {
      leds[i].fadeToBlackBy(255 - breathe * 2);
    } else {
      leds[i].maximizeBrightness(breathe * 2 - 255);
    }
  }
}
```

The color for the LEDs has been set to green. This color is being mixed with a breathing effect, which gives an appearance of the LEDs slowly pulsing on and off. This is done by having the brightness slowly increase and decrease in a sinusoidal way; sin() function is used to achieve this effect. The code also modifies the brightness depending on the value of the sine function to give the LEDs a 'breathing' effect. The timing for the sine function is done in such a way that each LED will be out of sync with its neighbors, giving a more dynamic appearance.
