Your request to simulate a magnolia tree in the wind is quite subjective and abstract, but we can interpret this as a gentle, pulsating blending of pink (representative of magnolia flowers) and green (for the leaves) LEDs, with an occasional "gust of wind" that runs through the LEDs as a bright white wave.

Here is how we can code this:

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   
#define NUM_LEDS    30  
#define BRIGHTNESS  150    
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 20  

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);  
}

void loop() {
  MagnoliaTree();
  
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}
void MagnoliaTree() {
  static uint8_t startHue = 0;
  startHue++;
  FillLEDsFromPaletteColors(startHue);

  // Wind Effect - white that sweeps randomly through the LEDs
  if (random8() < 10)  // Control frequency of wind gusts with this
  {
    int pos = random16(NUM_LEDS);  // Pick a random LED
    leds[pos] = CRGB::White; // Set it to white
  }
  
}

void FillLEDsFromPaletteColors(uint8_t colorIndex)
{
  uint8_t brightness = 255;
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++)
  {
    leds[i] = ColorFromPalette(palette, colorIndex, brightness, LINEARBLEND);
    colorIndex += 3;
  }
}

CRGBPalette16 palette(CRGB::Pink, CRGB::Green, CRGB::Pink, CRGB::Black);
```

This code embodies our interpretation of a magnolia tree in the wind. It maintains a base pink and green hue representative of a magnolia tree which it fills in the LEDs. It then introduces an occasional white gust of wind. 

This is a very abstract interpretation and may not correspond to someone else's interpretation of a magnolia tree in the wind. Coding up these kinds of subjective requests can be quite challenging and fun!
