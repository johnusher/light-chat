This request seems to be a bit unclear as "Cheese and Onion" doesn't represent a clear specification for modifying the code. Given the uncertainty of the request, we can follow the instruction given for such a case:

We'll modify the code to flash all LEDs red twice before returning to the original pattern.

So, the new code is:

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   
#define NUM_LEDS    30

#define BRIGHTNESS  150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  FlashRed();
  ChristmasLights();
  
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void FlashRed() {
  // Flash all LEDs red twice
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  delay(1000);

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Black;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  delay(1000);

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  delay(1000);

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Black;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  delay(1000);
}

void ChristmasLights() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::Green;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::White;
  }

  // Optional: Add a twinkling effect  
  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 50) {
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black;
    }
  }
}
```
This code first flashes the LEDs red twice in the FlashRed() function. It turns all LEDs red, waits for a second, turns them all off, waits for another second, turns them all red again, waits for one more second, and finally turns them all off again. After this sequence of flashing, the regular Christmas lights pattern is displayed. For this confusion in the request, the fallback option (flashing all LEDs red twice) is implemented first. However, the specific modification based on "Cheese and Onion" was not clear and thus was left unimplemented.
