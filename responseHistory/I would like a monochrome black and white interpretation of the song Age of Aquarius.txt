Creating a monochrome interpretation of the song Age of Aquarius on an LED strip using the Arduino platform and the FastLED library directly translates the audio into light effects can be a bit abstract because of the Arduino's hardware limitations.

However, it can be interpreted in the following way: The song's theme is about peace, harmony, and a new age that is dawning. This can be represented by a slow but steady transition from black (off LEDs) to white (fully bright/full on LEDs), representing the transition from the old age to the new Age of Aquarius.

Remember that this is quite abstract and the LEDs themselves will not be able to play the song or any kind of music.

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN         6
#define COLOR_ORDER     GRB
#define CHIPSET         WS2812B
#define NUM_LEDS        30
#define BRIGHTNESS      150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 100 

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000); 
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  AquariusEffect();

  FastLED.show(HALF);
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void AquariusEffect() {
  static uint8_t brightness = 0;

  fill_solid(leds, NUM_LEDS, CRGB::White);
  fadeToBlackBy(leds, NUM_LEDS, brightness);
  brightness++;  

  if (brightness == 255) {
    brightness = 0;  
  } 
}
```

In the `AquariusEffect` function, we're using a static variable `brightness` that slowly increments every frame (it goes from 0 to 255 then back to 0 and so on). This is used to gradually and continuously fade the strip from black to white and back to black, creating a loop.
