```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B 
#define NUM_LEDS    30  
#define BRIGHTNESS  150
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 60

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS); 
  FastLED.clear();
}

void loop() {
  RainbowCircle();
}

void RainbowCircle() {
  for (int lap = 0; lap < 8; lap++) {
    int speed = 5 + 20 * lap;  
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
      leds[i] = CHSV(i * 256.0 / NUM_LEDS + lap * 256.0 / 8, 255, 255); 
      FastLED.show();
      FastLED.clear();
      delay(1000 / speed); 
    }
  }
}
```

In the new implementation, the RainbowCircle function creates the desired effect. Here's a brief explanation of how it works.

1. We run a for loop for eight laps.
2. We calculate the speed of the LED dot as a function of the lap number. The higher the lap number, the higher the speed (lesser the delay).
3. Inside each lap, we run through all the LEDs in the strip.
4. We set the hue of the LED dot based on its index and lap number. This makes the dot change color as it goes along the strip.
5. We clear the LED strip after showing each LED to make sure that only one LED is active at a time.
6. We introduce a delay inversely proportional to the speed, ensuring that the speed is increased with each lap.
