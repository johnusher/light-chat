I'm sorry but the request you're asking for is not feasible. LED lights, especially the ones used with arduino, are not capable of showing detailed images or patterns such as a grizzly bear eating a caribou. They are typically used to generate vibrant, multi-colored light patterns or themes.

As requested, when an implementation can't be provided, all LEDs will flash red twice and the existing pattern will be displayed:

```
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  // do not change
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  // do not change
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B   // LED chipset. do not change
#define NUM_LEDS    30  // number of LEDs in the LED strip. do not change this value.
#define BRIGHTNESS  150   // set brightness of all LEDs. 150 is default
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5   // 20 is very fast, 10 is normal, 5 is slow. Above 30 is too fast.

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000); // delay before we start
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
  for(int i=0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(500);

  for(int i=0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Black;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(500);

  for(int i=0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red;
  }
  FastLED.show();
}

void loop() {
  for(int i=0; i<NUM_LEDS; i++){
    leds[i] = CRGB::Black;
  }
  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(500);

  ChristmasLights();

  FastLED.show();
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void ChristmasLights() {

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::Green;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::White;
  }

  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 50) {
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black;
    }
  }
}
```
This program will initialize the LEDs, flash them all in red color twice, and then proceed to running the Christmas Lights pattern. It's not possible to depict a grizzly bear eating a caribou with LEDs alone there's just not enough resolution for that. That's why instead of an implementation that could violate the requirements, a fallback is used where the LEDs are flashed red twice before running the usual Christmas Lights program.
