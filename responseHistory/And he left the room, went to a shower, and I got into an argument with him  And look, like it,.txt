Your instructions are not very clear and don't include specific requirements for modifying the code. From your description, I infer that you want some modification, possibly related to a button as you mentioned "finding a button", but further information as to the specific request would make it easier to assist you.

Nevertheless, I am going to add a functionality to the code to flash all LEDs in red color twice, as per your last instruction. For the rest, I would need more precise instructions. 

Here is the modified code that will flash all LEDs red twice before executing the existing LED pattern:

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     6  
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB  
#define CHIPSET     WS2812B  
#define NUM_LEDS    30 
#define BRIGHTNESS  150    
#define FRAMES_PER_SECOND 5   

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  FastLED.addLeds<CHIPSET, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);
  FastLED.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS);
}

void loop() {
  flashAllLEDsRedTwice();
  ChristmasLights(); 
  FastLED.show(); 
  FastLED.delay(1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND);
}

void flashAllLEDsRedTwice() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) leds[j] = CRGB::Red;
    FastLED.show();
    delay(500);  // half second delay
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) leds[j] = CRGB::Black;
    FastLED.show();
    delay(500);  // half second delay
  }
}

void ChristmasLights() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i += 3) {
    leds[i] = CRGB::Red; 
    if (i + 1 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 1] = CRGB::Green;
    if (i + 2 < NUM_LEDS) leds[i + 2] = CRGB::White;
  }
  int brightness = 64;
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_LEDS; j++) {
    if (random8() < 50) {
      leds[j] = CRGB::Black; 
    }
  }
}
```
This modification adds the function, flashAllLEDsRedTwice(), which flashes all LEDs red twice times. The delay function is used to pause for a period after LEDs get turned on or off. This function is called in the loop before the ChristmasLights function, so the red flash will happen once every time the loop starts over.
